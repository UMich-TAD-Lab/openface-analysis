## Outline/Description

This is the file where I'll turn cp_full (generated by OpenFacePrep) into a more condensed dataset. I don't want to use every single AU, because that's a lot of AUs and we can't build a model that involves every AU!

First, you need to do a nice lit review and how other papers coherently smush a lot of individual AUs together. Most likely you'll take an EMFACs-like approach and just calculate emotional intensity based on AU intensit for four emotions: anger, fear, happiness, and sadness. You also want to create one more not-technically-a-emotion: pain. This is easy, you just do the formula that's in that IEEE Cohn paper, but exclude AU43 from the formula. 

The generated .csv file should just include six variables: id, anger, fear, happiness, sadness, and pain (although pain isn't technically an emotion).

## Load in data

```{r}
cp_full <- read.csv(file="C:/Users/jrcala/Documents/My Research/RStudio/cp_full.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
#cp_full <- read.csv(file="/Users/Julianna/Desktop/data/cp_full.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
cp_full$X <- NULL
```

## Pain

```{r}

```
