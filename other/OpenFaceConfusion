## R packages

While there are many R packages that can conduct mixed modeling, the two most popular choices are the [lme4 package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/lme4.pdf) with the lmer command and the [nlme package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nlme/nlme.pdf) with the lme command. Both are suitable alternatives to SAS' PROC MIXED command: [lme4 here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SASmixed/vignettes/Usinglmer.pdf), [nlme here](http://www.solutionmetrics.com.au/support/splus82win/lmeSAS.pdf). 

The biggest difference between nlme and lme is that nlme allows you to specify a correlation structure (e.g. AR1), while lme4 automatically [defaults to unstructured and is unable to be changed.](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/86958/variance-covariance-structure-for-random-effects-in-lme4) However, it's 100x easier to specify non-nested random effects in lme4 than nlme, so if I used nlme, I could only have one random effect or I would have to nest one random effect within the other.

Other packages include [glmmTMB](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmmTMB/glmmTMB.pdf) and [brms](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/brms.pdf). However, glmmTMB seems to offer nothing more than what nlme can offer and brms is used for Bayesian regression modelling, which wasn't used in Lopez-Duran 2014.

## Models

On March 27th, I went to CSCAR and had an appointment with Kerby where we discussed how to replicate Melissa's model in R. He told me that the two models below are the closest models I'm going to get to Melissa's model. However, it is not an exact replica of Melissa's model because what Melissa did is not replicable in R. 

In Melissa's analyses, she put the AR1 on the random effects, although she likely should've put it on the error. This can be fixed by putting the random effect on different lines (aka as different statements) in SAS syntax, or by removing TimeBeforePeak and TimeAfterPeak as random effects entirely; you could just have TBP and TAP as fixed effects. The only random effect would be id. 

Additionally, Kerby said that I need to choose between having random slopes or having a AR1 correlation structure. I cannot have both at the same time. `mod1` was made in `nlme` and has the random effect of subject and an autoregressive correlation structure. `mod2` was made in `lme4` and has two random effects: random slopes for TimeBeforePeak and TimeAfterPeak. He also questioned that ThreatCompc was significant as a main effect and as an interaction with the many time variables. He says it makes more sense for ThreatCompc just to be significant as part of an interaction.

Out of curiousity, I also tested another model: made in `lme4` that had random intercepts and slopes for TimeBeforePeak and TimeAfterPeak. However, that model was identical to the model that just had random slopes. So there is no point in adding random intercepts to a `lme4` model. 

```{r echo=TRUE, results = 'hide'}
# Random intercept with ar1 structure
mod1 <- lme(cortvalue ~
            timebeforepeak + # Fixed effect
            timeafterpeak + # Fixed effect
            baseline + # Fixed effect
            ThreatCompc + # Fixed effect
            ThreatCompc*timebeforepeak + # Interaction
            ThreatCompc*timeafterpeak + ThreatCompc*baseline, # Interaction
            random = ~1|id, # Random intercept for Subject
            corr = corAR1(), # Specifies AR1 structure
            method = "REML", # Specifies REML fit
            na.action = na.exclude, # removes NA values
            data = data)
```

```{include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
summary(mod1)
```

```{r echo=TRUE, results = 'hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Random slopes with unconstrained structure
mod2 <- lmer(cortvalue ~

            baseline + # Fixed effect
            ThreatCompc + # Fixed effect
            ThreatCompc*timebeforepeak + # Interaction
            ThreatCompc*timeafterpeak + # Interaction
            ThreatCompc*baseline + # Interaction
            (timebeforepeak|id) + (timeafterpeak|id), # Random slopes
            # Default unconstrained cor structure
            data = data)
```

\end{aligned}$

That's all. I like mod1 better; Intercept is significant there. I also think having the ar1 structure is important, more important than having TimeBeforePeak and TimeAfterPeak as random effects. Also I keep getting an error with `tab_model` on mod2.
