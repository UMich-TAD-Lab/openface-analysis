### Outline/Description

This file will be where all the primary data analysis occurs. First, in a totally separate .rmd file, you'll want to convert cp_whatever to a "long" format, meaning that every time for cortisol will have its own row. This long dataset will also have to include everything else too: gender/demographic data, AUs, CTQ, etc.

Then, you're going to run a model that looks like this...

mod1 <- lm(cortisol~time+time^2+sex+AU1+AU1*time+AU1*time*time^2)

...but it's not going to be a lm() model, it's going to be a multilevel growth curve model, so you'll probably need to use the lme4() package with the lmer() command. This will produce a fixed effects table that represents the parameters of everything that you put in the above model to predict cortisol. Then you need to tell R what your random effects are, which is the intercept and time. 

Then you do something with landmark registration, but that's kind of already done, so you need to ask someone who ask access to that dataset to share it with you.

All the instructions can be found in Lopez-Duran 2014. Do NOT do anything involving AUC!
